// This declarative test runner adds a layer on top of e2etest/base. The added layer allows us to test in a declarative style,
// saying what to do, but not how to do it.
// In particular, it lets one test cover a range of different source/dest types, and even cover both sync and copy.
// See first test in zt_enumeration for an annotated example.

// A note on test frameworks.
// We are just using GoLang's own Testing package.
// Why aren't we using gocheck (gopkg.in/check.v1) as we did for older unit tests?
// Because gocheck doesn't seem to have, or expose, any concept of sub-tests. But we want: suite/test/subtest
// (subtest = scenario in our wording below).
// Why aren't we using stretchr/testify/suite? Because it appears from the code there that tests (and subtests) within a suite cannot be parallelized
// (Since suite.SetT() manipulates shared state).

// RunScenarios is the key entry point for declarative testing.
// It constructs and executes scenarios (subtest in Go-speak), according to its parameters, and checks their results
