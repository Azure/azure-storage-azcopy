// This declarative test runner adds a layer on top of e2etest/base. The added layer allows us to test in a declarative style,
// saying what to do, but not how to do it.
// In particular, it lets one test cover a range of different source/dest types, and even cover both sync and copy.
// See first test in zt_enumeration for an annotated example.

// RunTests is the key entry point for declarative testing.
// It constructs and executes tests, according to its parameters, and checks their results
