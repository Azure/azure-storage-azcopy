// TODO: consider how to add tests to cover the following

// Running these tests doesn't ensure that AZCOPY_E2E_EXECUTABLE_PATH points to an UP TO DATE build of the app.
// Could we somehow make it do that?

// Piping (we don't have any piping tests in the new suite yet)

// --cap-mbps
// page blob auto pacer
// exclusiveStringMap (usage of it, by the STE)
// Resume
// Operations other than copy and sync
// Account-to-account (i.e. whole of account) copies (since right now we only support single-container copies in the declarative tests)
