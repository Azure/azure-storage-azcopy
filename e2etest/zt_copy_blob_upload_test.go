	//   therefore need to be cleaned up in the deferred cleanup)
	// - information about the results of the test run, including any error, any caputured output and logs etc
	// - Validate methods to validate those results. By default, every ValidateXXX method includes validation that
	//   the transfer succeded. That can be turned off with something like like r.ExpectJobStatus(...Failed) before
	//   calling a Validate method
	//
	// In addition to the RunCopy method here, there would be RunSync, RunList etc.
	//
	// To specify files with certain sizes, best notation I can find is to just use something like "filename:20K"
	// i.e. choose a separator, and make our own syntax for what comes after it, and have our setup code process
	// it accordingly. (We lose the ability to put that separator into test filenames - with this test harness/helper method -
	// but for the rare tests where we need that I think we can just write unit-style test directly against the relevant classes)
