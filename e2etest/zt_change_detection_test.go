// Purpose: Tests for detecting that source has been changed during transfer

// TestDetectFileChangedDuringTransfer tests that we can detect files changed during transfer, for all supported
// pairwise source-dest combinations.
// We test all pairs here because change detection depends on both the source info provider and the xfer-... code.
// The latter differs between upload and download.
