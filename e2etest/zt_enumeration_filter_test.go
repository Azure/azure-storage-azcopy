// Purpose: Tests for the filtering functionality (when enumerating sources)

// Please leave the following test at the top of this file, where it can serve as an easy-to-find annotated example.
// We won't normally put this many comments in a test, but this one has the verbose comments to explain the declarative test
// framework
func TestFilter_IncludePath(t *testing.T) {
	// This will test IncludePath once for each source resource type.
	// For source resource types that support both Copy and Sync, it will run the test twice, once with Copy and once with Sync.
	//  Copy: Blob -> Blob
	//  Copy: Local -> Blob
	//  Copy: Files -> Files
	//  Copy: AWS -> Blob
	//  Copy: ADLS Gen2 -> Local
	// That's 5 scenarios in total, but we only need to specify the test declaratively _once_.  The eOperation and eTestFromTo
	// parameters automatically cause this test to expand out to the 5 scenarios. (If we had specified eOperation.CopyAndSync()
	// instead of just eOperation.Copy(), then for the first three listed above, RunTests would have run Sync as well, making
	// it 8 scenarios in total. But include-path does not apply to Sync, so we did not specify that here)
