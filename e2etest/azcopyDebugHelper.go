	//    Gops is needed by TestRunner.isLaunchedByDebugger(), and it's also needed by GoLand's Attach To Process (step 2 below)
	// then
	// 1. Set a breakpoint on the line below
	// 2. When the breakpoint is hit, use Attach To Process to manually attach your debugger to the running AzCopy process
	// 3. Then you MUST continue past the breakpoint that you set here (i.e. on the line below). Any breakpoints you've set in AzCopy will then be hit.
	//    (Note that some IDEs, e.g. GoLand, will give you two separate debug tabs/contexts, one for the tests exe, and one for AzCopy. So make sure you hit run/continue in the right tab)
