// In particular, it assumes that there will not be lots and lots of different hosts in the cache,
// and so it has no ability to clear them or reduce the size of the cache, and it runs one
// permanent GR per cache entry. That assumption makes sense in AzCopy, but is not correct in general (e.g.
// if used in something with usage patterns like a web browser).
// TODO: should we one day find a better solution, so it can be contributed to mattn.go-ieproxy instead of done here?
//    or maybe just the code in getProxyNoCache could be contributed there?
// TODO: consider that one consequence of the current lack of integration with mattn.go-ieproxy is that pipelines created by
//    pipeline.NewPipeline don't use proxyLookupCache at all.  However, that only affects the enumeration portion of our code,
//    for Azure Files and ADLS Gen2. The issues that proxyLookupCache solves have not been reported there. The issues matter in
