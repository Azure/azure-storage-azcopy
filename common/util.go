	 * We can take this up after migration to new SDK. The pipeline infra may not be same then.
	 * 1. At someplaces we use Blob SDK directly to create pipeline - ex getBlobCredentialType()
	 *    We should create pipeline through helper functions create<Blob/File/blobfs>pipeline, where we
	 *    handle errors appropriately.
	 * 2. We should either do a http.Get or net.Dial instead of lookIP. If we are behind a proxy, we may 
	 *    not resolve this IP. #2144
	 * 3. DNS errors may by temporary, we should try for a minute before we give up.
