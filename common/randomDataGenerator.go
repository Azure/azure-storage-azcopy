// SendRandomDataExt is an optionally specified file suffix, used for generating test data. To use,
// generate a SPARSE disk file that has zero on-disk size, but a large logical size.
// Give it a distinctive extension. E.g. myBigFile.azCopySparseFill
// Then set the command-line parameter to put that extension into this variable.
// The result will be that AzCopy will upload the full logical size of the sparse file, with all its content as pseudo-random
// bytes.  So you can have, for example, something that occupies 0 bytes on your disk, but gets uploaded as 10 TB of random data.
