// This serves as a backstop, to help make sure that secrets don't get logged.
// It does search and replace of the types of credentials that are expected to exist in an
// azCopy application (which are typically auth tokens inside URLs).
// While we already have code that redacts these from known request headers and request URLs,
// they can still be put into errors (e.g. HTTP errors) and if those errors are logged then those
// secrets will leak into the logs if we don't have this class to filter them out.
// The alternative would be to filter at all sites where such errors (and other things) may be
// logged, but that's less maintainable in the long term.
