// NewDirReader makes a Linux directory reader which uses a pool of go-routines to do the lookups from
// name of directory entry to full os.FileInfo.
// Why do we need this? Because on Linux os.Readdir does the same lookups, but it does them sequentially which hurts performance.
// Alternatives like https://github.com/karrick/godirwalk avoid the lookup all together, but only if you don't need any information
// about each entry other than whether its a file or directory.  We definitely also need to know whether its a symlink.
// And, in our current architecture, we also need to get the size and LMT for the file.
