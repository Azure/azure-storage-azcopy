// after the last file is removed.  Note that maybe the apparent last file isn't the last (e.g.
// there are other files, still to be deleted, in future job parts), in which case any failed deletion
// will be retried if there's a new "candidate last child" removed.
// Takes URLs rather than strings because that ensures correct (un)escaping, and makes it clear that we
// don't support Windows & MacOS local paths (which have cases insensitivity that we don't support here).
