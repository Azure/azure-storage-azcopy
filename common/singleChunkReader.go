// A instance of this type cannot be used by multiple threads (since it's Read/Seek are inherently stateful)
// The reader can throw away the data after each successful read, and then re-read it from disk if there
// is a need to retry the transmission of the chunk. That saves us the RAM cost of  from having to keep every
// transmitted chunk in RAM until acknowledged by the service.  We just re-read if the service says we need to retry.
// Although there's a time (performance) cost in the re-read, that's fine in a retry situation because the retry
// indicates we were going too fast for the service anyway.
