const copyCmdShortDescription = "Copies source data to a destination location"

const copyCmdLongDescription = `
Copies source data to a destination location. The supported directions are:
  - local <-> Azure Blob (SAS or OAuth authentication)
  - local <-> Azure Files (Share/directory SAS authentication)
  - local <-> ADLS Gen 2 (SAS, OAuth, or SharedKey authentication)
  - Azure Blob (SAS or public) -> Azure Blob (SAS or OAuth authentication)
  - ADLS Gen 2 (SAS or public) -> ADLS Gen 2 (SAS or OAuth authentication)
  - ADLS Gen2 (SAS or OAuth authentication) <-> ADLS Gen2 (SAS or OAuth authentication)
  - ADLS Gen2 (SAS or OAuth authentication) <-> Azure Blob (SAS or OAuth authentication)
  - Azure Blob (SAS or public) -> Azure Files (SAS)
  - Azure Files (SAS) -> Azure Files (SAS)
  - Azure Files (SAS) -> Azure Blob (SAS or OAuth authentication)
  - AWS S3 (Access Key) -> Azure Block Blob (SAS or OAuth authentication)
  - Google Cloud Storage (Service Account Key) -> Azure Block Blob (SAS or OAuth authentication)

Please refer to the examples for more information.

Advanced:

AzCopy automatically detects the content type of the files when uploading from the local disk, based on the file extension or content (if no extension is specified).

The built-in lookup table is small, but on Unix, it is augmented by the local system's mime.types file(s) if available under one or more of these names:

- /etc/mime.types
- /etc/apache2/mime.types
- /etc/apache/mime.types

On Windows, MIME types are extracted from the registry. This feature can be turned off with the help of a flag. Please refer to the flag section.

A note about using a wildcard character (*) in URLs:

There's only two supported ways to use a wildcard character in a URL. 
- You can use one just after the final forward slash (/) of a URL. This copies all of the files in a directory directly to the destination without placing them into a subdirectory. 
- You can also use one in the name of a container as long as the URL refers only to a container and not to a blob. You can use this approach to obtain files from a subset of containers. 

Download the contents of a directory without copying the containing directory itself.
 
  - azcopy cp "https://[srcaccount].blob.core.windows.net/[container]/[path/to/folder]/*?[SAS]" "/path/to/dir"

Download an entire storage account.

  - azcopy cp "https://[srcaccount].blob.core.windows.net/" "/path/to/dir" --recursive

Download a subset of containers within a storage account by using a wildcard symbol (*) in the container name.

  - azcopy cp "https://[srcaccount].blob.core.windows.net/[container*name]" "/path/to/dir" --recursive

Download all the versions of a blob from Azure Storage listed in a text file (i.e, versionidsFile) to local directory. Ensure that source is a valid blob, destination is a local folder and versionidsFile is a text file where each version is written on a separate line. All the specified versions will get downloaded in the destination folder specified.

  - azcopy cp "https://[srcaccount].blob.core.windows.net/[containername]/[blobname]" "/path/to/dir" --list-of-versions="/another/path/to/dir/[versionidsFile]"

Copy a subset of files within a flat container by using a wildcard symbol (*) in the container name without listing all files in the container.

  - azcopy cp "https://[srcaccount].blob.core.windows.net/[containername]/*" "/path/to/dir" --include-pattern="1*"

Copy a single blob to another blob by using a SAS token.

  - azcopy cp "https://[srcaccount].blob.core.windows.net/[container]/[path/to/blob]?[SAS]" "https://[destaccount].blob.core.windows.net/[container]/[path/to/blob]?[SAS]"

Copy a single blob to another blob by using a SAS token and an OAuth token. You have to use a SAS token at the end of the source account URL if you do not have the right permissions to read it with the identity used for login. 

  - azcopy cp "https://[srcaccount].blob.core.windows.net/[container]/[path/to/blob]?[SAS]" "https://[destaccount].blob.core.windows.net/[container]/[path/to/blob]"

Copy one blob virtual directory to another by using a SAS token:

  - azcopy cp "https://s3.amazonaws.com/[bucket*name]/" "https://[destaccount].blob.core.windows.net?[SAS]" --recursive=true

Copy blobs from one blob storage to another and preserve the tags from source. To preserve tags, use the following syntax :
  	
  - azcopy cp "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[source_container]/[path/to/directory]?[SAS]" "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[destination_container]/[path/to/directory]?[SAS]" --s2s-preserve-blob-tags=true

Transfer files and directories to Azure Storage account and set the given query-string encoded tags on the blob. 

	- To set tags {key = "bla bla", val = "foo"} and {key = "bla bla 2", val = "bar"}, use the following syntax :
		- azcopy cp "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[source_container]/[path/to/directory]?[SAS]" "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[destination_container]/[path/to/directory]?[SAS]" --blob-tags="bla%20bla=foo&bla%20bla%202=bar"
	- Keys and values are URL encoded and the key-value pairs are separated by an ampersand('&')
	- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-index-how-to?tabs=azure-portal
  - While setting tags on the blobs, there are additional permissions('t' for tags) in SAS without which the service will give authorization error back.

  - azcopy cp "https://storage.cloud.google.com/[bucket*name]/" "https://[destaccount].blob.core.windows.net/?[SAS]" --recursive=true

To copy files changed before or after the AzCopy job has started, AzCopy provides date/time in the job log in ISO8601 format (search for 'ISO 8601 START TIME' in the job log) that can be used with the --include-after and --include-before flags, see examples below. This is helpful for incremental copies.

Copy a subset of files modified on or after the given date/time (in ISO8601 format) in a container by using the include-after flag.

  - azcopy cp "https://[srcaccount].blob.core.windows.net/[containername]?[SAS]" "https://[dstaccount].blob.core.windows.net/[containername]?[SAS]" --include-after='2020-08-19T15:04:00Z''"

Copy a subset of files modified on or before the given date/time (in ISO8601 format) in a container by using the include-before flag.

  - azcopy cp "https://[srcaccount].blob.core.windows.net/[containername]?[SAS]" "https://[dstaccount].blob.core.windows.net/[containername]?[SAS]" --include-before='2020-08-19T15:04:00Z'"

// ===================================== SYNC COMMAND ===================================== //
const syncCmdShortDescription = "Replicate source to the destination location"

const syncCmdLongDescription = `
The last modified times are used for comparison. The file is skipped if the last modified time in the destination is more recent. Alternatively, you can use the --compare-hash flag to transfer only files which differ in their MD5 hash. The supported pairs are:
  
  - Local <-> Azure Blob / Azure File (either SAS or OAuth authentication can be used)
  - Azure Blob <-> Azure Blob (either SAS or OAuth authentication can be used)
  - ADLS Gen2 <-> ADLS Gen2 (either SAS or OAuth authentication can be used)
  - Azure File <-> Azure File (Source must include a SAS or is publicly accessible; SAS authentication should be used for destination)
  - Azure Blob <-> Azure File

The sync command differs from the copy command in several ways:

  1. By default, the recursive flag is true and sync copies all subdirectories. Sync only copies the top-level files inside a directory if the recursive flag is false.
  2. When syncing between virtual directories, add a trailing slash to the path (refer to examples) if there's a blob with the same name as one of the virtual directories.
  3. If the 'deleteDestination' flag is set to true or prompt, then sync will delete files and blobs at the destination that are not present at the source.

Advanced:

Please note that if you don't specify a file extension, AzCopy automatically detects the content type of the files when uploading from the local disk, based on the file extension or content.

The built-in lookup table is small but on Unix it is augmented by the local system's mime.types file(s) if available under one or more of these names:
  
  - /etc/mime.types
  - /etc/apache2/mime.types
  - /etc/apache/mime.types

On Windows, MIME types are extracted from the registry.

By default, sync works off of the last modified times unless you override that default behavior by using the --compare-hash flag. So in the case of Azure File <-> Azure File,
the header field Last-Modified is used instead of x-ms-file-change-time, which means that metadata changes at the source can also trigger a full copy.

// ===================================== DOC COMMAND ===================================== //

const docCmdShortDescription = "Generates documentation for the tool in Markdown format"

const docCmdLongDescription = `Generates documentation for the tool in Markdown format, and stores them in the designated location.

By default, the files are stored in a folder named 'doc' inside the current directory.
`

// ===================================== BENCH COMMAND ===================================== //
const benchCmdShortDescription = "Performs a performance benchmark"

// TODO: document whether we delete the uploaded data

const benchCmdLongDescription = `
Runs a performance benchmark by uploading or downloading test data to or from a specified destination. 
For uploads, the test data is automatically generated.

The benchmark command runs the same process as 'copy', except that: 

  - Instead of requiring both source and destination parameters, benchmark takes just one. This is the 
    blob container, Azure Files Share, or ADLS Gen 2 File System that you want to upload to or download from.

  - The 'mode' parameter describes whether AzCopy should test uploads to or downloads from given target. Valid values are 'Upload'
    and 'Download'. Default value is 'Upload'.

  - For upload benchmarks, the payload is described by command line parameters, which control how many files are auto-generated and 
    how big they are. The generation process takes place entirely in memory. Disk is not used.

  - For downloads, the payload consists of whichever files already exist at the source. (See example below about how to generate
    test files if needed).
  
  - Only a few of the optional parameters that are available to the copy command are supported.
  
  - Additional diagnostics are measured and reported.
  
  - For uploads, the default behaviour is to delete the transferred data at the end of the test run.  For downloads, the data
    is never actually saved locally.

Benchmark mode will automatically tune itself to the number of parallel TCP connections that gives 
the maximum throughput. It will display that number at the end. To prevent auto-tuning, set the 
AZCOPY_CONCURRENCY_VALUE environment variable to a specific number of connections. 

All the usual authentication types are supported. However, the most convenient approach for benchmarking upload is typically
to create an empty container with a SAS token and use SAS authentication. (Download mode requires a set of test data to be
present in the target container.)
  
`

const benchCmdExample = `Run an upload benchmark with default parameters (suitable for benchmarking networks up to 1 Gbps):'

   - azcopy bench "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]?<SAS>"

Run an upload benchmark with a specified block size of 2 MiB and check the length of files after transfer:

   - azcopy bench "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]?<SAS>" --block-size-mb 2 --check-length

Run a benchmark test that uploads 500 files, each 500 MiB in size, with a log level set to only display errors:

   - azcopy bench "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]?<SAS>" --file-count 500 --size-per-file 500M --log-level ERROR

Run a benchmark test that uploads 100 files, each 2 GiB in size: (suitable for benchmarking on a fast network, e.g. 10 Gbps):'

   - azcopy bench "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]?<SAS>" --file-count 100 --size-per-file 2G

Same as above, but use 50,000 files, each 8 MiB in size and compute their MD5 hashes (in the same way that the --put-md5 flag does this
in the copy command). The purpose of --put-md5 when benchmarking is to test whether MD5 computation affects throughput for the 
selected file count and size:

   - azcopy bench --mode='Upload' "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]?<SAS>" --file-count 50000 --size-per-file 8M --put-md5

Run a benchmark test that uploads 1000 files, each 100 KiB in size, and creates folders to divide up the data:

   - azcopy bench "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]?<SAS>" --file-count 1000 --size-per-file 100K --number-of-folders 5
 
Run a benchmark test that downloads existing files from a target

   - azcopy bench --mode='Download' "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]?<SAS?"

Run a download benchmark with the default parameters and cap the transfer rate at 500 Mbps:

   - azcopy bench --mode=Download "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]?<SAS>" --cap-mbps 500

Run an upload that does not delete the transferred files. (These files can then serve as the payload for a download test)

   - azcopy bench "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]?<SAS>" --file-count 100 --delete-test-data=false
