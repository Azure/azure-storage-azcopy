AzCopy is a command line tool that moves data into/out of Azure Storage.
To report issues or to learn more about the tool, go to github.com/Azure/azure-storage-azcopy

The general format of the commands is: 'azcopy [command] [arguments] --[flag-name]=[flag-value]'.
`

// ===================================== COPY COMMAND ===================================== //
const copyCmdShortDescription = "Copies source data to a destination location"

const copyCmdLongDescription = `
Copies source data to a destination location. The supported pairs are:
  - local <-> Azure Blob (SAS or OAuth authentication)
  - local <-> Azure File (Share/directory SAS authentication)
  - local <-> ADLS Gen 2 (OAuth or SharedKey authentication)
  - Azure Block Blob (SAS or public) <-> Azure Block Blob (SAS or OAuth authentication)

Please refer to the examples for more information.

Advanced:
Please note that AzCopy automatically detects the Content Type of the files when uploading from the local disk, based on the file extension or content (if no extension is specified).

The built-in lookup table is small but on Unix it is augmented by the local system's mime.types file(s) if available under one or more of these names:
  - /etc/mime.types
  - /etc/apache2/mime.types
  - /etc/apache/mime.types

On Windows, MIME types are extracted from the registry. This feature can be turned off with the help of a flag. Please refer to the flag section.

Replicate a source to a destination location. The last modified times are used for comparison, the file is skipped if the last modified time in the destination is more recent. The supported pairs are:
  - local <-> Azure Blob (either SAS or OAuth authentication can be used)

Please note that the sync command differs from the copy command in several ways:
  0. The recursive flag is on by default.
  1. The source and destination should not contain patterns(such as * or ?).
  2. The include/exclude flags can be a list of patterns matching to the file names. Please refer to the example section for illustration.
  3. If there are files/blobs at the destination that are not present at the source, the user will be prompted to delete them. This prompt can be silenced by using the corresponding flags to automatically answer the deletion question.

Advanced:
Please note that AzCopy automatically detects the Content Type of the files when uploading from the local disk, based on the file extension or content (if no extension is specified).

The built-in lookup table is small but on Unix it is augmented by the local system's mime.types file(s) if available under one or more of these names:

const syncCmdExample = `
Sync a single file:
  - azcopy sync "/path/to/file.txt" "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]/[path/to/blob]"

Sync an entire directory including its sub-directories (note that recursive is by default on):
  - azcopy sync "/path/to/dir" "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]/[path/to/virtual/dir]"

Sync only the top files inside a directory but not its sub-directories:
  - azcopy sync "/path/to/dir" "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]/[path/to/virtual/dir]" --recursive=false

Sync a subset of files in a directory (ex: only jpg and pdf files, or if the file name is "exactName"):
  - azcopy sync "/path/to/dir" "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]/[path/to/virtual/dir]" --include="*.jpg;*.pdf;exactName"

Sync an entire directory but exclude certain files from the scope (ex: every file that starts with foo or ends with bar):
  - azcopy sync "/path/to/dir" "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]/[path/to/virtual/dir]" --exclude="foo*;*bar"

Note: if include/exclude flags are used together, only files matching the include patterns would be looked at, but those matching the exclude patterns would be always be ignored.
