AzCopy is a CLI tool that moves data into/out of Azure Storage.
For this preview release, only the Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 service is supported.
Please refer to the Github README for more information.
If you encounter any issue, please report it on Github.

The general format of the commands is: 'azcopy [command] [arguments] --[flag-name]=[flag-value]'.

// hold a pointer to the global lifecycle controller so that commands could output messages and exit properly
var glcm = common.GetLifecycleMgr()

// Execute adds all child commands to the root command and sets flags appropriately.
// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.

	azcopyAppPathFolder = azsAppPathFolder

	if err := rootCmd.Execute(); err != nil {
		glcm.ExitWithError(err.Error(), common.EExitCode.Error())
