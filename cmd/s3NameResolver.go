// S3BucketNameToAzureResourcesResolver resolves s3 bucket name to Azure Blob container/ADLS Gen2 filesystem/File share.
// For Azure, container/filesystem/share's naming follows:
// 1. Lower case letters, numbers and hyphen.
// 2. 3-63 length.
// 3. Name should not contain two consecutive hyphens.
// 4. Name should not start or end with hyphen.
// For S3, bucket's naming follows:
// 1. The bucket name can be between 3 and 63 characters long, and can contain only lower-case characters, numbers, periods, and dashes.
// 2. Each label in the bucket name must start with a lowercase letter or number.
// 3. The bucket name cannot contain underscores, end with a dash or period, have consecutive periods, or use dashes adjacent to periods.
// 4. The bucket name cannot be formatted as an IP address (198.51.100.24).
// Two common cases need be solved are:
// 1. bucket name with period. In this case, AzCopy try to replace period with hyphen.
// e.g. bucket.with.period -> bucket-with-period
// 2. bucket name with consecutive hyphens. In this case, AzCopy try to replace consecutive hyphen, with -[numberOfHyphens]-.
// e.g. bucket----hyphens -> bucket-4-hyphens
// The resolver checks if there are naming collision with other existing bucket names, and try to add suffix when there is any collision.
// e.g. There is buckets with name: bucket-name, bucket.name. Azcopy will resolve bucket.name -> bucket-name -> bucket-name-2
// All the resolving should be logged and warned to user.
